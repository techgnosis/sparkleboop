# ISSUE TRACKING

Read @AGENTS.md to learn how to track epics and issues. This is incredibly important. NEVER write any markdown files for tracking work. All work must be tracked in bd.

# BUILDING THE PROJECT
You have access to all the flutter tools and can build at your discretion.

You also have access to scripts in the ./scripts directory that can be used to start and stop the `flutter run --machine` command. You can then communicate with flutter via the pipes that it creates. This is the correct way to develop this app.
